Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Nice test coverage.  It would help to know what the inputs are,
and if the outputs are what is expected.  Telling the user if
the test passed or not would also be a good idea.  Good work
testing zero and multiple duplicates.

I'm a little put off by the f-bombs in your code for the Huffman
problem.  I'm not usually upset by that kind of language, but it
is not professional, so a word to the wise is to NOT make a habit
of that.  

Again, because you don't actually say on the output what you are
testing and whether it passed, it is very difficult to determine if
it works or not.  You don't include a "decode()" method, except to
have IT return yet another f-bomb, so that has to count against you.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 11.5 out of 13 which is 88.46% which is a B-plus

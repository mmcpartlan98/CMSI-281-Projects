Homework04 Evaluation
======================

Not sure what's going on with this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks pretty good, but could improve and you STILL
don't have file headers.  That fact alone costs you 3 points.

You didn't bother doing all four of the programs.  I could only
find the in order and the string hasher.  That costs you another
12 points.

The tree traverser seems to work, but without more expansive testing
I have to read the source code.  Testing is pretty minimal, which
costs you yet another point.

The string hasher output is really hard to understand.  Looking
at the code doesn't really help much without comments, either,
but you've lost so many points already that I'm inclined to give
you the benefit of the doubt, although there's no menu which was
even in the book for you already...

Definitely not your best work, gentlemen...

These were from Abell's repo.
